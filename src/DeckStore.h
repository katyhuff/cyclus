DeckStore is a helper function that provides semi-automated management of
material resource buffers (e.g. model stocks and inventories).

Methods that begin with a "set", "make", "push", or "pop" prefix change the
state/behavior of the store; other methods do not.  Default constructed
material store has zero (finite) capacity. Resource popping occurs in the order
the resources were pushed (i.e. oldest materials are popd first).
